# Scratch Debugger

This is a monorepo for our Scratch Debugger.

The Scratch project consists of [a bunch of different subprojects](https://github.com/scratchfoundation/scratch-gui/wiki/Getting-Started#repos), each with their own repository.
Our debugger needs one additional package and a fork of two Scratch packages:

- The judge
- The VM
- The GUI

Below are installation instructions, assuming you use the monorepo.

## Installation instructions

1. Have an environment with Node, npm and Bash.
2. Clone this repository.
3. Initialize the submodules: `todo`
4. Run the installation script: `./install.sh`

## Build instructions

Once all dependencies are installed, you should build the Scratch GUI as normal:

TODO
